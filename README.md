## Overview

**Tria Contacts** is a single-page React app that displays, searches, and manages a contact list with clean UI and real-app interactions.  
It supports adding, editing, and viewing contacts â€” all with local state updates and live data fetched from a **mock REST API**.

---

## API Integration

Instead of hardcoding data, the app fetches contacts from a **public Mock API** hosted on [Mocki.io](https://mocki.io/).  
This mimics real-world API communication and demonstrates asynchronous fetching, loading states, and error handling.

- **Endpoint used:**  
  `https://mocki.io/v1/a927097d-93a7-4063-ad80-f01cd2c69d77`

- **How it works:**  
  The app sends a `fetch()` request to the endpoint, retrieves a JSON array of contacts, and dynamically renders them in the UI.  

---

## Features

- **Search by name, email, or phone**  
  Search bar highlights matching text dynamically.

- **Add new contacts**  
  Opens a modal form and automatically assigns a random avatar color.

- **Edit existing contacts**  
  Click any contact to open a popup card; edit and save details directly.

- **View contact details**  
  Pop-up modal with name, email, and phone info.

- **Smooth UX**  
  Sticky header, scrollable list box, and responsive design.

- **Dark minimal UI**  
  Built with pure CSS (no frameworks) and designed for clarity and polish.
